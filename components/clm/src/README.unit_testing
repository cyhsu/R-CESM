# To run all CLM unit tests on caldera, run the following command:
#
# Note that the 'execca' command is yellowstone-specific: it opens an
# interactive session on caldera. This isn't needed on other systems.
#
# Also note that, on yellowstone/caldera, this requires 'module load all-python-libs'
#
# The creation of a temporary directory ensures that you are doing a completely
# clean build of the unit tests. (The use of the --clean flag to run_tests.py
# cleans most, but not all of the files created by the unit test build.) For
# rerunning the tests after an incremental change, you can instead use an
# existing build directory.

execca ../../../cime/tools/unit_testing/run_tests.py --test-spec-dir=. --compiler=intel --mpilib=mpich2 \
--use-openmp --mpirun-command=mpirun.lsf --build-dir `mktemp -d --tmpdir=. unit_tests.XXXXXXXX`
